This repo is to test methods of feeding Nintendo Video Spotpass files

Nintendo Video is a discontinued service for the Nintendo 3DS, used to download videos for viewing on the console.

This repo aims to explore methods of feeding archived BOSS (Spotpass) files to the application through the use of a web debugger.
For this I use Charles, due to its ability to map local files as request responses.
